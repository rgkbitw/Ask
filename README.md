### Ask - A Chat Bot which answers queries posed in natural language.

### Motivation:
    1. The driving force for this project was to have a attendent at facebook page of
       our college's annual event.
    2. The attendent was aimed to be a guide for the people seeking information about the
       event.
    3. The workflow was simple: The user queries some information, and if the bot identifies 
        it as valid and has an answer for it then it just returns that answer otherwise it asks the
        user to filter his query again.
    4. The user could pose the queries in his language. The bot would only look at some significant 
        keywords to make meaning out of it.
    5. To add on, we used duckduckgo's api for answering simple factual questions.
    6. The bot did not use any natural language processing as it was meant to be simple.
    7. Flask framework was used to host the requests and generate a response.
