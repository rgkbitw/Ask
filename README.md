### Ask - A Chat Bot which answers queries posed in natural language.

### Motivation:

1. The motivation for this project was to have an attendent at the facebook page of our college event.
2. The attendent was aimed to be a guide for the people seeking information about the event.
3. The workflow was simple: The user queries some information, and if the bot identifies it as valid and has an answer for it then it just returns the answer otherwise it asks the user to filter his query again.
4. The user could pose the queries in his language. The bot would only look at some significant keywords to make meaning out of it.
5. To add on, we used Duckduckgo's api for answering simple factual questions.
